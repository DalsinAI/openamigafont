/* of_call_on_stack: openfont.library does its work on a stack of its own.
 * Programs often call with 4 KB of stack, and shaping and the rasteriser
 * want more than that. Every call into the core holds
 * the library's lock, so one stack serves them all.
 *
 * The stack the caller passes, as the routine reads it after saving six
 * registers (24 bytes): 24(sp) the return, 28(sp) sss, 32(sp) fn, 36(sp) a,
 * 40(sp) b. StackSwap changes only the stack pointer and the task's bounds;
 * d2-d4/a2-a3 survive it and the call, as the C convention keeps them.
